# Fundus_US-Uveal-Melanoma-Diagnosis
## Overview
This repository provides the models and pretrained weights for the automated classification of uveal melanoma (UM) and choroidal nevi using ultra-widefield fundus photography and B-scan ocular ultrasound (longitudinal and transverse views), as described in: Dadzie AK, Iddir SP, Abtahi M, et al (2025). Attention-Based Multimodal Deep Learning for Uveal Melanoma Classification Using Ultra-Widefield Fundus Images and Ocular Ultrasound

## Models Included
1. Ultra-widefield fundus images (Optos)
2. Longitudinal ultrasound (LUS)
3. Transverse ultrasound (TUS)
4. Attention-based fusion.
